title: I <3 Javascript
---

It been some time, I have started writing Javascript and its absolutely amazing. I started loving it more,
when JS moved from just being a front-end language to, **all in one**. Be it, frontend, backend and even
desktop apps now. Since my start with [SaleCycle][1], I have been working on JS all the time and considering the fact
that we have wide variety of clients, for which we have to write custom JS; things become more exciting (or annoying? :smile: ). The reason
being, the scripts that we work on vary as per client websites + specs. The more complicated the DOM structure is,
the more lines of code you have to write, to make it fail proof.

After joining the core engineering team, it been just JS, JS, JS all along!! Whether it be writing internal
engineering tools in [Electron][2] or writing Chrome/Firefox extensions or NodeJS middlewares. With the advent of ES6, things have been
looking bright for JS as a programming language. As compared to yester years, where one who wrote JS was not considered a programmer [here][3] and 
now (2016), JS is huge, [here][4]. As the article mentions, if you get a hold of pure functions, proto inheritance + new ES6/7 offerings; you're **sorted**!!

So, what are you waiting for, get yourself indugled in writing & learning JS and trust me, the way you think (especially, who come from background like Ruby/Python) will change forever.
Please don't get me wrong, every language has its own pros & cons. And it really depends on what scenario you are applying them :smile:. I myself have been a massive fan of Ruby from the day, I met
Sinatra & RoR, but Node is in a different league altogether.

I always follow this [awesome list][5], to get the best out of various tooling and tutorials available. The following might be of your interest:

1. [awesome-nodejs][6]
2. [awesome-javascript][7]
3. [ES6 tools][8]
4. [If you are into react :smile:] [9]
5. [ES6 classes][10] (I personally recommend this, as its worth every penny!)

Hope this helps someone :smile:!
